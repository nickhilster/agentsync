# EOD Status Report - 2026-02-22

Project: `agentsync`  
Branch: `master`  
Prepared by: Codex

## Executive summary

Today's work moved AgentSync from a tracker-only workflow to a stronger operator UX:

- Added an animated **AgentSync Live** dashboard (webview) with state-aware controls.
- Expanded **AgentSync Details** panel with clearer onboarding and handoff visibility.
- Added stale-session recovery (`Clear Active Session`) and stale-state handling.
- Added one-command local release loop (`npm run vsix:refresh`) for faster iteration.
- Captured planning artifacts for targeted handoff notes and cross-agent integration.

## Delivered

1. UI/UX improvements
- New `AgentSync Live` webview view with matrix-style animation and live state badge.
- Existing tree view renamed/positioned as `AgentSync Details`.
- Added quick actions in panel/dashboard for first-time usability.

2. Handoff visibility
- Added handoff-aware sections:
  - Assigned to me
  - Shared with me
  - Blocked/Stale
- Wired panel/dashboard to `.agentsync/handoffs.json`.

3. Operational state model
- State modes now represented as `Ready`, `Busy`, `Waiting`.
- Added stale-session support:
  - Command: `AgentSync: Clear Active Session`
  - Config: `autoStaleSessionMinutes` (0 disables auto-stale)

4. Dev/test workflow
- Added script-based local package/reinstall flow:
  - `npm run vsix:refresh`
  - `npm run vsix:package`
  - `npm run vsix:install`

5. Documentation and planning artifacts
- Added/updated docs, questionnaires, and response files for cross-agent coordination.
- Added master plan: `docs/masterplan-targeted-agent-handoff-notes.md`.

## Validation performed

- `node --check extension.js`
- JSON parse validation for `package.json`
- Repeated local package/install cycles with:
  - `npm run vsix:refresh`

Notes:
- Project does not currently expose a baseline automated test script.
- Build/test/deploy health checks remain `Not configured` by default.

## Current known issues / risks

1. Session state drift
- `state.json` can remain active after interrupted workflow; mitigated by Clear Active Session and auto-stale display logic.

2. Packaging scope
- Root protocol docs and planning markdown files are currently present in workspace and can enter VSIX unless packaging strategy is tightened.

3. Test coverage
- Core state and handoff logic has no dedicated automated tests yet.

## Resume checklist for next session

1. Reload Extension Development Host and verify:
- Live dashboard loads (no "no data provider" message)
- Start Session -> Busy
- End Session -> Ready/Waiting based on context
- Clear Active Session correctly unblocks stale state

2. Decide and set default `autoStaleSessionMinutes` for templates/new workspaces.

3. Add focused tests for:
- `getOperationalState`
- `getSessionStaleInfo`
- handoff bucketing and stale handoff classification

4. Confirm packaging/file-inclusion policy for non-runtime markdown artifacts.

## High-signal files to review first

- `package.json`
- `README.md`
- `templates/AgentTracker.md`
- `templates/agentsync.json`
- `schemas/handoffs.schema.json`
- `scripts/refresh-vsix.js`
